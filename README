Dependencies:
    - gtk2.0 development libraries
    - libconfig++

Installation:
    - a "make" will hopefully make the binary 'gexecute'

Post installation:
    - to make gExecute actually useful, a shortcut should be added to your window manager that links to the 'gexecute' binary
    - ~/.gexecuterc will also have to be made and configured, a sample is provided
