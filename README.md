Dependencies
=============
* gtk2.0 development libraries
* libconfig++

Installation
============
Issuing "make" will hopefully make the binary. There is no "make install" at the moment.

To make gExecute actually useful, a shortcut should be added to your window manager that links to the 'gexecute' binary.

~/.gexecuterc will also have to be made and configured, a sample is provided 

Disclaimer
==========
I quickly made this a long time ago until it worked for me.  If anyone actually uses it, you can bug me [(Erik Nomitch)](http://github.com/eriknomitch) about it.
