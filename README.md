Disclaimer
==========
I really only worked on this a long time ago until it worked okay for me... if I have some time I'll actually make it halfway decent.  If anyone actually uses it, you can bug me about it: https://github.com/eriknomitch

Dependencies
=============
* gtk2.0 development libraries
* libconfig++

Installation:
==
Issuing "make" will hopefully make the binary. There is no "make install" at the moment.

To make gExecute actually useful, a shortcut should be added to your window manager that links to the 'gexecute' binary

~/.gexecuterc will also have to be made and configured, a sample is provided
